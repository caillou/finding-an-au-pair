## We are looking for an au-pair for&nbsp;2022&nbsp;–&nbsp;2023.

We are a somewhat unconventional family living in Zurich. We have a room-mate, are very close to our neighbours, live in the garden in the summer, have a Sauna, …

The spoken language is mostly German and Swiss-German.

Read on to find out more!

## Who We Are

**Miriam (40) and Pierre (43)** — Miriam is a German who has been living in Zurich for the past 15 years. Actually, she just got the Swiss citizenship. She works as a project-lead in a web agency. Pierre is a Software developer. He has two kids from a first relationship who visit every 2 weeks, Frank (13) and Lou (15).

Au-pairs have lived with us since 2019. We really love this experience!

**Greta (5) and Charlie (3)** are Miriam’s and Pierre’s kids. Greta is a clever character, loves to climb trees and draw. Charlie is very curious and never gets tired of running around.

## Who You Are


We are looking for someone open to a new experience. Someone with a big heart for our kids. Someone who is open-minded for our lovely neighbours and who is looking for a new temporary family.

## The Job


You will basically become part of our family and help wherever you can. You will look after the kids during the days. Mosts of the time one of us will be there too. Like everyone who lives here, you will help around the house. We love to cook together in the evenings, sometimes we watch a movie together, sometimes we retire to our rooms.

You will visit a weekly german language course and get a monthly salary of 700 CHF / 615 Euro.

Ideally you will be here before the end of November.

## The Neighbourhood


We love our neighbourhood and the people who live here.

We live in a 300 year old farm in the the city. We have a big garden that we share with the other families, with a **sauna** and Pizza stove. We spend the summer in the Garden, mostly with our neighbours. We eat together on the street wile the kids ride the bikes and play ping-pong. It feels like a village in the middle of the town. **It really is a magical place with nice people.**

While being 15 minutes away form the city centre, the forest is at a 5 minutes walking-distance away. If you like hiking or jogging, this is perfect. You can take the kids to the forest, stay in the garden or go to the near-by swimming-pool. In the winter, there is enough to see or do in the city.

## Zurich


Zurich is the biggest city of Switzerland. It often feels like a small town, but there are no limits to what can be done here. You will probably love this city.

You can easily reach every part of Zurich by bicycle in 8 minutes. When it rains, the Tram leaves every 7 minutes.



There is a lake, many parks, nice hipster coffee-shops, several shopping areas, and many more things. If you get bored of Zurich, you can visit other near-by cities by train or go hiking or skiing in the mountains.
